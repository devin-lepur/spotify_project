# spotify_project
Create a website that interacts with the Spotify API

There exist libraries like Spotipy that automate many of
the tasks that will be done but will not be used to encourage
learning of the API will the documentaion Spotify provides

This Project is currently a work-in-progress. Currently the 
end goal for this project is not entirely decided. The website 
will interact with the Spotify API to display some sort of 
information to the user but that is the extent of the goal at
this moment. More detail will be provided when more prorgress 
will be reached.

Main learning goal: Learning and exposure to HTML, JS, CSS and
how these languages interact. Ability to learn an API using
provided documentation.
